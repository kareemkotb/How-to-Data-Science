# How-to-Data-Science
The road map to learn data science without going to univeristy
***
Using [Data Science OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/data-science?tab=readme-ov-file) as a base we will need to make sure the selected courses can cover everything listed in OSSU and if a specific course isnt listed inside of our chosen course then we can find some online for it. For the following the coming tags will be used: 
(D = Only Datacamp, 365 = Only 365 Data science, E = External, C = Combination of Datacamp and 365 Data Science

# Courses
A common misconception is that the course needs to be long for it to be usefull but thats not true, these courses should be a priority 

## Datacamp ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d890ac7-a47c-4f77-b36a-f4b19b242326)


The important thing about finding the perfect course is finding the majority of technical skills that are needed under one roof. 
The best example is [Associate Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python), in 90 hours you will learn and good portion of the technical skills, but to complete the last course from Datacamp we will want [Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-python) and in 26 hours we will get SQL and a bit of Machine Learning. For $13 per month learning the majority of the skills is very worth it.

Even though there is alot of similatries compared to datacamp but there is extra skills that it teaches and retaking some skills for the certificate is worth it [Data Scientist](https://learn.365datascience.com/career-tracks/data-scientist/). there is 2 elective classes while I opted for "The Complete Data Visualization" and "SQL + Tableu + Python" you can pick anything from 35 extra elective classes for no extra charge. A super and when i mean super i mean it, you can also pick another course from their which is [Financial Analyst](https://learn.365financialanalyst.com/career-tracks/financial-analyst/?preview=1) which will help in the demand of strong accounting, financial forecasting, analysis, and reporting abilities. Which you wont really need some of them but these extra skills may make you look better candidate.

Now the most important thing, Projects
I split projects into 2 types, Mini Projects and Meta Projects:
- Mini Projects are small projects that are simple to create and usually has a singular purpose and/or function
- Meta Projects usually combine Mini Projects together with integration from different programming languages

Secondly the projects are split into 2 Catogories:
- Technical Skills
- Industry
  - Healthcare
  - Sports
  - Oil and Gas
  - Big Tech
  - Esports
  - Insurance
  - Telecom
  - Cybersecurity
  - Retails

Picking one techincal Skill for one industry will make a good/unique Mini Project for you.
Later on you should combine multiple Mini Projects for a certain goal and Industry
