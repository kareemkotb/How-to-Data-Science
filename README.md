***
Hello, Im Kareem a Business Information System Student (or maybe a ex-student ðŸ¤·) and I want to become a Data Scientist. One of the major problems I have encountered was not a clear guidelines and tips to help me on the journey, as there is no one course you could take to become ready as a Data Scientist so I have decided to do it myself.
I hope this is Helpful

# Basic Information
### What is Data Science
Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data.

### Countries that Pay well for Data Scientist
As pay is an important factor for most people in this economy, these countries are among the best/highest in pay
- Switzerland
- United States of America
- Denmark
- Germany
- Singapore

If you want more information you can read more here [The Top 5 Countries Offering the Highest Pay to Data Scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-countries-offering-highest-pay-data-9cove/) and here
[10 Highest Paying Countries for Data Analysts](https://www.instarem.com/blog/highest-paying-countries-for-data-analysts/#:~:text=The%20highest%2Dpaying%20countries%20for,high%20demand%20for%20data%20analysts.)

### Industries that use Data Science
Industries matter alot, mainly because 1) Which project you will need to work on 2) If you enjoy the industry you will enjoy your work, so for example if you work in a football club like Liverpool and you are a big fan of the sport, heck even if you are a Liverpool fan you will enjoy the work there more
- Banking
- Healthcare
- Automotive

For more information you can read here [The Best Industries for Data Science Specialists in 2024](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/the-best-industries-for-data-science-specialists/)

### Skills to Gain
I will mention the sources needed later with their links but here are all the Skills you need, Some will be free and some wont but its way cheaper than university
1. Mathematics
2. Python / R
3. Machine Learning
4. Databases
5. Visualization
6. Github

### Order to Learn
Mathemetics > Machine Learning > Python > Databases > Visualization > Github

# Skills
### Mathematics
For Math we will need:
1. Algebra --> [College Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/college-algebra)
2. Statistics and Probability --> [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
3. Calculus --> [APÂ®ï¸Ž/College Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4bb84b-cfca-4c41-a0e4-847fe4a37057)

For all 3 we will be using Khan Academy, why , well its simple its free and it has a mastery system. For the mastery system its important to be able to see your progress overtime which will cause to stick as u can see your progress and might be a source of motivation

Having all the units Mastered shows you understand everything + its AP Mathematics so they are high enough level to be able to work on projects without being confused all the time

### Machine Learning
We will be doing [Machine Learning Specialization | Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

What will you learn
- Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods
- Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection

Andrew Ng is really good and experienced Teacher and machine learner, This course Should max 2-3 Month

If you decided on picking R then you can do this [Machine Learning Scientist in R | Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-r)


### Python VS R
While Python and R were created with different purposes â€“Python as a general-purpose programming language and R for statistical analysisâ€“nowadays, both are suitable for any data science task. However, Python is considered a more versatile programming language than R, as itâ€™s also extremely popular in other software domains, such as software development, web development, and gaming. Because of the learning curve of python (Its Easy) we will be doing python but if you decide to learn python you can read for Alot of comparison between them both [Python vs R for Data Science: Which Should You Learn?](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/python-vs-r-for-data-science-whats-the-difference) But i highly Highly Highly recommended learning Python for 2 reasons 1) Works best from experience with learn order 2) More Job Opportunities 

Now the Programming part starts, you WILL need to apply to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/) if you are a student, as it will give u access to alot of things even stuff that isnt related to Data Science/Data Analysis

We will be doing both ( all from Datacamp ( and if you got the Github Student Pack you have 3 month free))
1. [Associate Data Scientist in Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) OR [Associate Data Scientist in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-r)
2. [Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-python) OR [Data Scientist in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-r)

Then we will either do the first or both if u want
1. [Data Scientist Associate Certification](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/get-started/associate-data-scientist/overview)
2. [Data Scientist Certification](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/get-started/data-scientist/overview)

Ok why these 2 sets, well the first 2 are the courses teaching alot of skills and the second one certifcate which is basically a piece of paper saying you know your stuff

### Databases
Now we have 2 types of databases SQL and NOSql and if i go around explaining the difference we will be here till tommorrow but if you want to dive in [SQL vs. NoSQL](https://www.coursera.org/articles/nosql-vs-sql) AND [MongoDB vs SQL](https://intellipaat.com/blog/mongodb-vs-sql/#:~:text=In%20comparison%20to%20the%20SQL,of%20data%2C%20however%20MongoDB%20does.)


For SQL we will be learning MySQL and will learn it from [MySQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/default.asp)

For noSQL we will learn MongoDB using our Github Student Pack we will do [MongoDB Python Developer Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/mongodb-python-developer-path)


our exam for MongoDB will be [MongoDB Associate Developer Exam](https://learn.mongodb.com/pages/mongodb-associate-developer-exam)


### Visualizatin Tools
Finally we will go with Tableau over PowerBI and you can read more about it here [Power BI vs. Tableau: Which is The Better Business Intelligence Tool in 2024?](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/power-bi-vs-tableau-which-one-should-you-choose)

and finally the last course will be [Tableau Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/tableau-fundamentals)
***
Whats left now is doing projects that are related to the industry you want to join for example if you want to join as a data scientist in the healthcare industry then having projects about healthcare will be more beneficial to you.
