# How-to-Data-Science
The road map to learn data science without going to univeristy
***
All of this will be assuming that you can spend a bit of money on the courses here and there. First of all is detetmine which techincal skills are needed for data science
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Tableu OR PowerBI
4. Mathematics
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Probability
5. Data Visualization
6. Machine Learing
- Linear Regression
- Tenserflow Deep Learning
7. Intergrating all Programming Skills

# Courses
A common misconception is that the course needs to be long for it to be usefull but thats not true, these courses should be a priority 

## Datacamp ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e543be-c6ea-4e47-aa83-ecf1bd3f0ada)

The important thing about finding the perfect course is finding the majority of technical skills that are needed under one roof. 
The best example is [Associate Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python), in 90 hours you will learn and good portion of the technical skills, but to complete the last course from Datacamp we will want [Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-python) and in 26 hours we will get SQL and a bit of Machine Learning. For $13 per month learning the majority of the skills is very worth it.
## 365 Data Science

Even though there is alot of similatries compared to datacamp but there is extra skills that it teaches and retaking some skills for the certificate is worth it [Data Scientist](https://learn.365datascience.com/career-tracks/data-scientist/). there is 2 elective classes while I opted for "The Complete Data Visualization" and "SQL + Tableu + Python" you can pick anything from 35 extra elective classes for no extra charge. A super and when i mean super i mean it, you can also pick another course from their which is [Financial Analyst](https://learn.365financialanalyst.com/career-tracks/financial-analyst/?preview=1) which will help in the demand of strong accounting, financial forecasting, analysis, and reporting abilities. Which you wont really need some of them but these extra skills may make you look better candidate.
