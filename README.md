# How-to-Data-Science
The road map to learn data science without going to univeristy
***
All of this will be assuming that you can spend a bit of money on the courses here and there. First of all is detetmine which techincal skills are needed for data science
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Tableu OR PowerBI
4. Mathematics
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Probability
5. Data Visualization
6. Machine Learing
- Linear Regression
- Tenserflow Deep Learning
7. Intergrating all Programming Skills

# Courses
A common misconception is that the course needs to be long for it to be usefull but thats not true, these courses should be a priority 

## Datacamp

The important thing about finding the perfect course is finding the majority of technical skills that are needed under one roof. 
The best example is [Associate Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python), in 90 hours you will learn and good portion of the technical skills, but to complete the last course from Datacamp we will want [Data Scientist in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-python) and in 26 hours we will get SQL and a bit of Machine Learning. For $13 per month learning the majority of the skills is very worth it
