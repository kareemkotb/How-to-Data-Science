Hello, Im Kareem a Business Information System Student (or maybe a ex-student ðŸ¤·) and I want to become a Data Scientist. One of the major problems I have encountered was not a clear guidelines and tips to help me on the journey, as there is no one course you could take to become ready as a Data Scientist so I have decided to do it myself.
I hope this is Helpful
