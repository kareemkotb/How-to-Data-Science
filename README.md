***
Hello, Im Kareem a Business Information System Student (or maybe a ex-student ðŸ¤·) and I want to become a Data Scientist. One of the major problems I have encountered was not a clear guidelines and tips to help me on the journey, as there is no one course you could take to become ready as a Data Scientit so I have decided to do it myself.
I hope this is Helpful

# Basic Information
### What is Data Science
Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data.

### Countries that Pay well for Data Scientist
As pay is an important factor for most people in this economy, these countries are among the best/highest in pay
- Switzerland
- United States of America
- Denmark
- Germany
- Singapore

If you want more information you can read more here [The Top 5 Countries Offering the Highest Pay to Data Scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-countries-offering-highest-pay-data-9cove/) and here

### Industries that use Data Science
Industries matter alot, mainly because 1) Which project you will need to work on 2) If you enjoy the industry you will enjoy your work, so for example if you work in a football club like Liverpool and you are a big fan of the sport, heck even if you are a Liverpool fan you will enjoy the work there more
- Banking
- Healthcare
- Automotive

### Skills to Gain
I will mention the sources needed later with their links but here are all the Skills you need, Some will be free and some wont but its way cheaper than university
1. Mathematics
2. Python / R
3. Machine Learning
4. Databases
5. Visualization
6. Github

### Order to Learn
Mathemetics > Machine Learning > Python > Databases > Visualization > Github

# Skills
### Mathematics
For Math we will need:
1. Algebra --> [College Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/college-algebra)
2. Statistics and Probability --> [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
3. Calculus --> [APÂ®ï¸Ž/College Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4bb84b-cfca-4c41-a0e4-847fe4a37057)

For all 3 we will be using Khan Academy, why , well its simple its free and it has a mastery system. For the mastery system its important to be able to see your progress overtime which will cause to stick as u can see your progress and might be a source of motivation

Having all the units Mastered shows you understand everything + its AP Mathematics so they are high enough level to be able to work on projects without being confused all the time

### Machine Learning
We will be doing [Machine Learning Specialization | Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

What will you learn
- Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods
- Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection

Andrew Ng is really good and experienced Teacher and machine learner, This course Should max 2-3 Month

### Python VS R
While Python and R were created with different purposes â€“Python as a general-purpose programming language and R for statistical analysisâ€“nowadays, both are suitable for any data science task. However, Python is considered a more versatile programming language than R, as itâ€™s also extremely popular in other software domains, such as software development, web development, and gaming. Because of the learning curve of python (Its Easy) we will be doing python but if you decide to learn python you can read for Alot of comparison between them both [Python vs R for Data Science: Which Should You Learn?](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/python-vs-r-for-data-science-whats-the-difference) But i highly Highly Highly recommended learning Python for 2 reasons 1) Works best from experience with learn order 2) More Job Opportunities
